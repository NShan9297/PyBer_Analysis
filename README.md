# PyBer_Analysis #

## **Project Overview** ##

A python based ride-sharing app company, "PyBer" has asked for a an anlysis on the data collected for rides based on city type. Pyber is looking to create more access to their ride sharing services and determine their affordability. Visulaization was performed by way of scatter plots, box-and-whisker plots, pie charts and line graphs on the gathered data from CSV files. We gathered distribuiton information and will view below. 


**Software Used**

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Matplotlib

Pandas

## **Results** ##

Overall, results show that there is a higher concentration of drivers and riders in the Urban cities. While the lowest concentration of riders and drivers is in Rural cities/towns. Suburban city types fall somewhere in between. The average fares for Rural areas are the highest and the Urban areas are the lowest. We also see that the average pay per driver is the highest in rural areas, and the lowest in Urban areas. Suburban areas fall in between for all categories but the data suggest that Suburban is more similar to the rural city types.



The pie charts below show the percentages of riders and drivers in each city type of all the ride info collected:

We are  able to see that the Urban Cities account for more than half of the rides and drivers of the 3 city types. 

Taking a deeper look, below we have a scatter plot showing the average fare amount and the number of rides by the city type
Here, we see that the Rural city types have the highest fares on average and the lowest ride rates of the 3 city types

This figure shows the total number of rides, drives, total fares spent on rides, average fares per ride and the average pay to drivers-based on city type:
