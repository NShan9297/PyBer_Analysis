# PyBer_Analysis #

## **Project Overview** ##

A python based ride-sharing app company, "PyBer" has asked for a an anlysis on the data collected for rides based on city type. Pyber is looking to create more access to their ride sharing services and determine their affordability. Visulaization was performed by way of scatter plots, box-and-whisker plots, pie charts and line graphs on the gathered data from CSV files. We gathered distribuiton information and will view below. 


**Software Used**

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Matplotlib

Pandas

## **Results** ##

Overall, results show that there is a higher concentration of drivers and riders in urban areas. While the lowest concentration of riders and drivers is in rural cities/towns. Suburban city types fall somewhere in between. 

The pie charts below show the percentages of riders and drivers in each city type of all the ride info collected:

Taking a deeper look, below we have a scatter plot showing the average fare amount and the number of rides by the city type
Here, we see that the Rural city types have the highest fares on average and the lowest ride rates of the 3 city types

This figure shows the total number of rides, drives, total fares spent on rides, average fares per ride and the average pay to driver:
